# cmma-base

A Leiningen template for CMMA-based projects.

## Usage

Install by hand with: `lein install`

Create new [CMMA-based](https://github.com/ohpauleez/cmma) projects with `lein new cmma-base myproject`

Then you should be able to `make repl` from within the new project.


From there you can manage dependencies with any tool you like (including CMMA).
You can also remove the `Makefile.cmma` file and work directly in the main Makefile, if you prefer.

If you use another tool (Boot, Leiningen, Maven) for dependency management and launching nREPL sessions,
you can redefine `CMMA_CLASSPATH_BIN` and the `nrepl` task,
and then remove the CMMA JAR - it's not used for anything else.
