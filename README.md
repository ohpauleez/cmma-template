# cmma-base

A Leiningen template for CMMA-based projects.

## Usage

Install by hand with: `lein install`

Create new CMMA-based projects with `lein new cmma-base myproject`

Then you should be able to `make repl` from within the new project.


From there you can manage dependencies with any tool you like (including CMMA).
You can also remove the `Makefile.cmma` file and work directly in the main Makefile, if you prefer.
